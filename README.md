⚡️ SPRINT 2: Part 2/2 - Create an E-commerce Application

🧩 Overview:
This project is an e-commerce web application developed to manage a shopping cart and apply product promotions.

It focuses on implementing the shopping cart logic and applying promotions to the final price.

The application must simulate key online store functionalities, such as adding and removing products, calculating totals, and validating forms.

🔗 Project Repository:

🎯 Objetives:

Develop an e-commerce application with the following features:

- Add and remove products.

- Calculate totals dynamically.

- Apply promotions to prices.

- Validate forms.

I- mprove DOM manipulation and real-time data synchronization.

      🧾 HTML5
      🎨 CSS3
      ⚙️ JavaScript (ES6+)
      💠 Bootstrap

⭐ Learnings and Challenges Encountered:
During this sprint, I reinforced my knowledge of JavaScript and its practical application in web development.

Implementation of the shopping cart logic.

Data synchronization and real-time total updates.

DOM and array manipulation to manage products and promotions.

Among the challenges encountered, I can mention:

When I implemented the promotions logic, the data synchronization (ensuring changes in the cart were reflected in the total calculations in real-time), and identifying and resolving errors in the function logic when the expected results weren't obtained. I have learned to interact with the DOM elements of the webpage and have become familiar with array manipulation.
